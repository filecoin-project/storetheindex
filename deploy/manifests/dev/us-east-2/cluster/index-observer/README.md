# Index Observer

This directory contains the `index-observer` _cluster-level_ Flux tenancy configuration that creates a K8S namespace dedicated to `index-observer`, along with all Flux CRDs to set up and manage continuous delivery for it.

Note that the [_application level_ manifests](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/index-observer/tree/main/deploy/manifests/dev/us-east-2) are located at the `index-observer` repo itself.
